## ck setup

```
ck setup [aws|gcloud]
```

Guided setup. Without an argument, it asks whether to set up AWS, Google Cloud, or both.

It writes standard files (`~/.aws/config`, gcloud configurations), so profiles you already have keep working.

## ck setup aws

```bash
ck setup aws
```

Add an AWS profile using one of:

- **SSO** (IAM Identity Center)
- **Access keys**
- **A chained role**, assumed from another profile

## ck setup gcloud

```bash
ck setup gcloud
```

Create or update a gcloud configuration, log in, and optionally set up Application Default Credentials (ADC). `ck setup gcp` is an alias.

## ck doctor

```bash
ck doctor
```

Check your installation and print the command that fixes each problem:

| Section | Checks |
|---|---|
| Common | `jq`, `python3` |
| AWS | AWS CLI v2, Session Manager plugin, `expect` and `nc` (for `ck ec2 upload`), profiles in `~/.aws/config` |
| Google Cloud | `gcloud`, configurations, ADC |
| Shell | CloudKit is sourced from `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` |

## ck status

```bash
ck status
```

Show the active AWS and gcloud sessions in this terminal. It makes no network calls. See [Sessions](/sessions/).

## ck version

```bash
ck version
```

Print the installed CloudKit version.

## ck help

```bash
ck help              # all commands
ck help <command>    # one command's options, e.g. ck help gce
```
